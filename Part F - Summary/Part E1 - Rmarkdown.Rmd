## Rmarkdown

**What is it**
* R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents

**Who is it for**
* For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

* For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).

* As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.


# What does Rmarkdown contains

It contains three important types of content:

* An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s.
* Chunks of R code surrounded by ```.
* Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.

## How does Rmarkdown works

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Lecture E-figure/Rmarkdown how it works 2.PNG")
```


# How does Rmarkdown works

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Lecture E-figure/Rmarkdown how it works.PNG")
```

## Bullet points

*   Bulleted list item 1

*   Item 2

    * Item 2a

    * Item 2b

1.  Numbered list item 1

1.  Item 2. The numbers are incremented automatically in the output.

## Wrting text

If you want to use latex just write `r str_c("$$")` 'some math' and end with two dollar signs


* Get italic text. Set \*italic\* which gives you *italic*.  
* Get bold text. Set \*\*bold\** which gives you **bold**.      
* If you want to use r programming in the text use `r inline()`.

## Examples with code in text

1. We have data about `r inline('nrow(diamonds)')` diamonds.  
  1.1. We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds.
1. Only `r inline('diamonds %>% filter(carat>2.5) %>% nrow()diamonds %>% filter(carat>2.5) %>% nrow()')` are larger than 2.5  
  1.1 Only `r diamonds %>% filter(carat>2.5) %>% nrow()` are larger than 2.5
  

## Tables in markdown

Printing tables to markdown aren't pretty. But with the package *kableExtra* it is easy to make readable tabels.

Example (Normal print)
```{r}
tibble::rownames_to_column(mtcars, var = "cartype") %>% 
  separate(col = cartype, into = c("brand", "car"),
           sep = fixed(" "),
           extra = "merge") %>% 
  group_by(brand) %>% 
  summarise(number = n(), mean_mpg_brand = mean(mpg), .groups = "drop") %>% head()
```


## Tables in markdown

Example (kableExtra print)
```{r eval = TRUE}
dt %>% kable('html') %>% 
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

## Example (kableExtra print)


```{r eval = TRUE}
dt %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_minimal()
```

## Example (kableExtra print)
```{r}

mtcars %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  select(mpg:wt) %>%
  rownames_to_column('cars') %>% # used to store row names (mutate deletes them)
  mutate(
  cyl = cell_spec(cyl, color = ifelse(cyl > 6, "white", "black"),
                  background = ifelse(cyl > 6, "red", "white"),
                  bold = ifelse(cyl > 6, T, F), align = "r")) %>%
  column_to_rownames('cars') %>% # used to put row names back in place
  kable(escape = F, table.attr = "style='width:90%;'") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = T)

```

## Example (kableExtra print)
```{r}
library(editrules)
people <- read.csv( file = "data/people.txt", stringsAsFactors = F, strip.white = T)
people %>% # used to store row names (mutate deletes them)
  mutate(
    age = cell_spec(age, color = case_when(age > 0 & age>=150~"white",
                                           age<18 & agegroup != "child" & status != "single"~"white",
                                           T~ "black"),
                    background = case_when(age > 0 & age>=150~"red",
                                           age<18 & agegroup != "child" & status != "single"~"red",
                                           T~ "white"),
                    bold = case_when(age > 0 & age>=150~T,
                                     age<18 & agegroup != "child" & status != "single"~T,
                                     T~ F), align = "r"),
    
    height = cell_spec(height, color = ifelse( height <=0, "white", "black"),
                    background = ifelse( height <=0, "red", "white"),
                    bold = ifelse( height <=0, T, F), align = "r")) %>% # used to put row names back in place
  kable(escape = F, table.attr = "style='width:90%;'") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = T)
  

```
